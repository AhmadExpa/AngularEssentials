Example provided is using an **Angular factory provider**. Specifically, it's creating an **`InjectionToken`** for the **`localStorage`** object, with the help of a **factory function**. Let’s break it down in detail:

```typescript
import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

export const LOCAL_STORAGE = new InjectionToken<Storage>('localStorage', {
  providedIn: 'root',
  factory: () => localStorage,
});
```

### What Type of Factory is This?
This is a **factory function** that **provides a built-in browser object** (`localStorage`). It's a **simple factory**, as it directly returns an existing object without any complex logic.

### Key Components in This Code:

1. **InjectionToken**: 
   - An `InjectionToken` is used to represent a specific value or object that can be injected into Angular components or services.
   - In this case, it is used to represent `localStorage`, a native browser API.

2. **`providedIn: 'root'`**: 
   - This means that the `LOCAL_STORAGE` token is provided at the **root level** of the application. It will act like a singleton—available throughout the entire app without needing to be provided explicitly anywhere else.

3. **factory: `() => localStorage`**: 
   - The factory function (`() => localStorage`) is responsible for **returning the `localStorage` object**. 
   - This is a **simple factory** function that provides an instance of the native `localStorage` object.

---

### What Is This Factory Doing?
This factory is providing a **global instance** of the browser's `localStorage` API, which allows you to use the **dependency injection system** to inject `localStorage` into your Angular services or components.

- **No complex logic** is involved here. The factory just returns the **existing `localStorage`** object from the browser.
- This is a **simple, direct factory** that provides access to an external resource (the `localStorage` object in this case).

---

### Use Case:
The reason to use this factory approach is to **inject** `localStorage` in a **testable** and **consistent** way throughout your application. By using Angular's DI system to provide `localStorage`, you can:

- **Mock** `localStorage` easily in unit tests by replacing it with a mock service or object.
- Ensure that `localStorage` is available as a **dependency**, making it easier to manage.

### Example of Injection:

```typescript
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { LOCAL_STORAGE } from './path-to-your-token';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<p>Check the console for localStorage usage</p>`
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(LOCAL_STORAGE) private localStorage: Storage) {
    console.log(this.localStorage.getItem('key'));
  }
}
```

Here, `localStorage` is injected into the component using the `LOCAL_STORAGE` token. This ensures that Angular’s DI system provides the `localStorage` object, which can be easily substituted or mocked when needed.

---

### Summary:

- This is a **simple factory** that returns the **`localStorage`** object from the browser.
- The factory is defined inside the `InjectionToken` configuration and provides a **global** instance of `localStorage`.
- The use of a factory like this allows you to manage external resources like `localStorage` through Angular's DI system, making your code **more testable** and **maintainable**.
