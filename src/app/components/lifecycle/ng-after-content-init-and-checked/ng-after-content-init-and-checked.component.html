<!-- This three-step process happens because:

The initial check ensures that the component is set up correctly. (One time)
The second check happens when a state change triggers a re-render.( when the onchangeInput is updated)
The third check ensures that any DOM changes (e.g., showing or hiding of the popup) are fully processed. (due to ngif)-->
