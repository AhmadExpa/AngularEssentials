# Dependency Resolution Modifiers in Angular

Angular provides several resolution modifiers that control how services are injected and resolved within an application. These modifiers include `providedIn`, `@Optional()`, `@Self()`, `@SkipSelf()`, and `@Host()`. Let's explore each one in detail.

## 1. `providedIn`: Controlling Service Scope
The `providedIn` modifier is part of the `@Injectable()` decorator. It defines where the service should be available:

- **`providedIn: 'root'`**: The service is singleton and available application-wide, shared across all modules that inject it.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyService {}
```

- **`providedIn: 'any'`**: A new instance of the service is created for each lazy-loaded module, offering separate instances for different app sections.

- **`providedIn: SomeModule`**: The service is scoped to `SomeModule` and its child components but is not globally available.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: SomeModule,
})
export class MyModuleService {}
```

## 2. `@Optional()`: Optional Dependency Injection
The `@Optional()` modifier allows Angular to inject a service only if it exists. If the service is unavailable, `null` is injected instead of throwing an error.

**Use Case**: Use `@Optional()` when the service may not always be available but your component can function without it.

```typescript
constructor(@Optional() private myOptionalService: MyService) {
  if (this.myOptionalService) {
    // Use the service
  } else {
    // Handle the case when the service is not provided
  }
}
```

## 3. `@Self()`: Resolve from the Current Injector
The `@Self()` modifier forces Angular to resolve the service from the current component’s injector, without checking parent injectors.

**Use Case**: Use `@Self()` when you need the dependency to be resolved only within the current component or module.

```typescript
constructor(@Self() private myService: MyService) {}
```

## 4. `@SkipSelf()`: Skip the Current Injector
The `@SkipSelf()` modifier instructs Angular to skip the current injector and look for the service in parent injectors.

**Use Case**: Use `@SkipSelf()` when you want to bypass a locally provided service and use one from a parent module.

```typescript
constructor(@SkipSelf() private myService: MyService) {}
```

## 5. `@Host()`: Resolve from the Host Element’s Injector
The `@Host()` modifier limits Angular to resolving the service from the host element’s injector or its immediate ancestors, stopping further up the hierarchy.

**Use Case**: Use `@Host()` when you want the service to be resolved only from the host element or its immediate parent components.

```typescript
constructor(@Host() private myService: MyService) {}
```

## Summary of Dependency Resolution Modifiers

| **Modifier**    | **Behavior** |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `providedIn`    | Defines where the service is provided: `root`, `any`, or a specific module. |
| `@Optional()`   | Injects the service if available; otherwise, `null` is injected. |
| `@Self()`       | Resolves the service only from the current injector. |
| `@SkipSelf()`   | Skips the current injector and resolves the service from a parent injector. |
| `@Host()`       | Limits resolution to the host element’s injector or immediate ancestors. |

These modifiers allow you to fine-tune how Angular resolves dependencies within your app.
