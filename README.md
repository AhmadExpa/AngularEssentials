This repository covers the core concepts of Angular from the very basics to HTTP client integration. It is the first part of my Angular learning journey, which I completed using the FreeCodeCamp Angular course.

## Topics Covered

- **Angular Fundamentals:**
  - Components, Modules, and Templates
  - Angular CLI and workspace setup
  - Data binding (Interpolation, Property, and Event Binding)
  - Directives (Structural and Attribute Directives like *ngIf, *ngFor, ngClass)
  - Angular Pipes (Built-in and custom pipes)
  
- **Services and Dependency Injection:**
  - Creating services
  - Injecting services using @Injectable
  - Managing shared data using services

- **Forms:**
  - Template-driven forms
  - Reactive forms
  - Form validation (Built-in and custom validators)
  - Handling form submissions

- **HTTP Client:**
  - Making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
  - Consuming REST APIs with HttpClientModule
  - Error handling in HTTP calls
  - Using RxJS operators (map, catchError, etc.)

This project showcases the basics and HTTP-related features of Angular, providing practical examples and code snippets to get hands-on experience.
